# LCPractice
All LC and Codeforces questions which I am targeting to solve in next few months

How to Create a PR:
1. Clone the repo in your local.
2. Then create a branch your local from the master.
2. Create a folder based on the Day. For ex: if you are working on Day 1, then you create a folder called Day-1 under the root folder.
3. After submitting changes to your branch, raise a PR (try git rebase instead of git pull)
4. Then we can merge your changes.

You are free to use your own language.
